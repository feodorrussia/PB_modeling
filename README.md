## Abstract

This study focuses on determining the stability of the peeling-ballooning (PB) mode, a key mechanism underlying the edge-localized modes (ELMs) phenomenon in tokamaks. These instabilities are critical for understanding plasma behavior and ensuring the stable operation of fusion devices. Machine learning models were trained using stability diagrams generated from numerical simulations of the PB mode, which represent their stability boundaries as functions of plasma parameters such as pressure gradient and current density.  
A comparison of different machine learning approaches revealed that trained models can accurately classify stable and unstable regions within the parameter space. These models provide a faster and more flexible alternative to traditional stability analyses while maintaining acceptable level of the accuracy. For example, they allow to distinguish ELMs from limit cycle oscillations (LCO), which is difficult to achieve with common methods, such as D-alpha emission measurements.
The proposed methodology enables more detailed studies of plasma instabilities and accelerates the processing of experimental data, contributing to the development of real-time diagnostic systems for tokamak operations.
